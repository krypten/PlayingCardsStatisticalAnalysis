# Statistical Analysis of Playing Cards (Descriptive Statistics: Final Project)

## Overview
In this project, I have conducted an experiment dealing with drawing from a deck of playing cards and you can see the writeup containing my findings [here](#analyis-report-and-steps).
This experiment will require the use of a standard deck of playing cards. This is a deck of fifty-two cards divided into four suits (spades (♠), hearts (♥), diamonds (♦), and clubs (♣)), each suit containing thirteen cards (Ace, numbers 2-10, and face cards Jack, Queen, and King). You can use either a physical deck of cards for this experiment or you may use a virtual deck of cards such as that found on random.org (http://www.random.org/playing-cards/). In this task, I have assigned each card a value: The Ace takes a value of 1, numbered cards take the value printed on the card, and the Jack, Queen, and King each take a value of 10.

## Analyis Report And Steps

### Plotting a histogram of card values
The histogram depicts the relative frequencies of the card values.

##### Frequency of the card value

##### Relative Frequency of the card value

### Obtaining samples from a deck of cards
I will get samples for the new distribution. Procedure: To obtain a single sample, shuffle my deck of cards and draw three cards from it. (I will be sampling from the deck without replacement.) Record the cards that I have drawn and the sum of the three cards’ values. Replace the drawn cards back into the deck and repeat this sampling procedure a total of at least thirty times.

### Descriptive statistics regarding sample taken
Include at least two measures of central tendency and two measures of variability.

Mean :- 			23.375<br/>
Median :- 			25.0<br/>
Mode :- 			28<br/>
Standard Deviation :-		5.94427245338<br/>
Interquartile range(IQR) :- 	9.25<br/>

### Plotting a histogram of sampled values
The histogram show sums for the sampled card.

##### Frequency of the sampled distribution card values

##### Normal Distribution of the sampled distribution card values

##### Questions

Q: How are both the histograms different, and  why is this the case? <br/>
A: 

### Estimates based on the sampled distribution
Make some estimates about values you will get on future draws.<br/>


Q. Within what range will you expect approximately 90% of your draw values to fall?<br/>
A. 

Q. What is the approximate probability that you will get a draw value of at least 20?<br/>
A.
